# Audio to Text Converter Repository

Welcome to the Audio to Text Converter Repository! This repository contains two folders, AudTex and AudTex1, each offering unique functionalities for converting audio files into text transcripts.

## AudTex1

AudTex1 is a Python script that provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for bidirectional text-to-speech and speech-to-text conversion. Here's what you need to know about AudTex1:

- **Technology Stack:** AudTex1 is developed using Python and utilizes the `tkinter` library for GUI development. It integrates `gtts` for converting text to speech and `SpeechRecognition` for converting speech to text.
- **Usage Instructions:** To use AudTex1, simply run the Python script. The GUI will allow you to input text and convert it to speech, as well as input speech for conversion to text.
- **Dependencies:** Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, including `tkinter`, `gtts`, and `SpeechRecognition`.
- **Contributions:** Contributions to AudTex1 are welcome! If you have ideas for improvements or new features, feel free to submit a pull request.
